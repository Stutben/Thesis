	abstract = {The ability to process large numbers of continuous data streams in a near-real-time fashion has become a crucial prerequisite for many scientiﬁc and industrial use cases in recent years. While the individual data streams are usually trivial to process, their aggregated data volumes easily exceed the scalability of traditional stream processing systems.},
